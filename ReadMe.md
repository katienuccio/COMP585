# Comp585
Serious Game for Visually Impaired


Goals for next week: Work on game design and implementation, reach out to Nirjon and Diane, and begin working on the documentation. Design interface. Basic wireframes for views.


Goal of the game: To help blind people learn to map out new indoor environments through a fun and interactive game.


How it will work: Using iBeacons as game markers and “prizes,” a player will use their phone to navigate around their environment. The phone will produce haptic feedback and emit noises when getting closer or farther to a “goal” beacon.

Client meetings: Weekly meetings on Thursdays at 2:30 alternating between Bishop and Pozefsky


Document sharing: Google docs
Design Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DfOLsLter1T6DJzuwqTk-67xxFyRm5LiqjR-HhBEVI0/edit?usp=sharing 


Repository sharing: GitHub
Game Repository: https://github.com/dpureco/Comp585


Game design: The game is going to be a mix of a scavenger hunt with RPG aspects. Players will choose classes to play as, and the goal for the players is to find all the “goal” beacons. As players find more and more beacons, they unlock new abilities for their chosen class.


Implementation: https://developers.google.com/beacons/  (research in progress)
